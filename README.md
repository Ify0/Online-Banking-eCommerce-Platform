# eCommerce Website Development using Struts2 Framework
Implemented a robust and dynamic banking eCommerce website running on Tomcat server with HTML/JSP frontend, closely resembling major eCommerce platforms like eBay. The website was built using the Struts2 Framework, a powerful Java-based MVC web framework. Data management was handled using MySQL as the relational database.

**Technical Stack:**

- Backend: Java with Struts2 Framework
- Frontend: HTML, JSP
- Database: MySQL
- Server: Apache Tomcat

**Key Features and Functionality:**

- **User Registration/Signup:** Designed a user-friendly registration system for new users to create accounts.

- **User Login:** Implemented session management to allow users to login securely and maintain their session across various pages.

- **Display Logged In User:** Integrated functionality to display the currently logged-in user at the top of all pages, providing a personalized user experience.

- **User Logoff:** Enabled users to securely logoff, ending their active session.

- **Profile Viewing:** Created a profile page for each user, allowing them to view their own profile as well as other users' profiles.

- **User List:** Implemented a feature to view a list of all registered users.

- **Item Listing:** Developed a system for users to add items for sale, and view all items currently listed for sale.

- **Bidding System:** Implemented a real-time bidding system, allowing users to make bids on listed items.

- **Bid Tracking:** Enabled users to view their own bids, and all bids made on a particular item.

This project provided hands-on experience with full-stack web development, including frontend design, backend logic, database management, and server handling. It also allowed me to deepen my understanding of the Struts2 Framework, MVC architecture, and session management.
